>> Changing locale for weather components
2 types of code you can use: 1) zip code; or 2) weather code
Find your weather code: go to www.weather.com, search for your city, find the code in the address bar. It consists of a string of alphabets & numbers, e.g. HKXX0049

Change the weather code:
- locate Config.js in the widget folder, open it on PC or iFile
- under the line “var weathercode = ‘XXX’”, replace the default weather code with your own. Do not remove the quotation marks.

>> Installation
LockHTML: /var/mobile/Library/LockHTML
GroovyLock: /var/mobile/Library/GroovyLock
SBHTML: /var/mobile/Library/SBHTML
iWidget: /var/mobile/Library/iWidgets

Requires Infostats2 for battery and RAM components to work.
Default LockBackground.html uses InfoStats2 for weather info. No configurations needed in Config.js. If you want to use the old weather code route, there is an alt html for that.


>> Changing locale for weather components (weather code route)
2 types of code you can use: 1) zip code; or 2) weather code
Find your weather code: go to www.weather.com, search for your city, find the code in the address bar. It consists of a string of alphabets & numbers, e.g. HKXX0049

Change the weather code:
- locate Config.js in the widget folder, open it on PC or iFile
- under the line “var weathercode = ‘XXX’”, replace the default weather code with your own. Do not remove the quotation marks.


>> LS widget position with notifications 
For widgets with the label (N), there is notification support.
You need groovyAPI installed. If you’re using Xen HTML, turn on legacy mode to use this function.
In Config.js, you can find two lines of settings under //Widget position with notifications//.

1. ShiftUp_Notif
   - This determines the position of the widget (with the exception of battery elements, if any) when notifications are present
   - To shift the widget up, enter a negative value, e.g. -20
   - To shift it down, enter a positive value

2. OriginalPos
   - This allows you to change the widget’s position on y-axis (without notifications) easily
   - This is of more use to GroovyLock users, since you can't move the widget on the lockscreen freely
   - You can move up or down most widget elements besides the battery-related ones
   - Negative value to shift up, positive value to shift down
